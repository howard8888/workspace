CCA8 Controller: drives, primitives ("policies"), and action center.

Concepts
--------
- Drives: numeric homeostatic values (hunger, fatigue, warmth) → derive 'drive:*' flags (ephemeral tags that are not written to worldgraph)
- Policy (primitive): behavior object with two parts -- trigger(...) and execute(...)
    -parameter 'world' represents the episode state, e.g., already standing? fallen?, cues present?, anchors/latest?
    -parameter 'drives' represent internal needs, i.e., homeostatic values (e.g., hunger, fatigue, etc)
        -drive tags are derived from numeric levels, e.g., hunger > 0.60 --> "drive:hunger_high"
        [note: worldgraph has only 3 families: pred:*, cue:*, anchor:* -- drive:* are ephemeral controller flags, not graph tags]
                   [action:* actually stored as "pred:action:*" although locally sometimes referred to as action:*]
                   [we still encode actions primarily as edge labels]
        [created by Drives.flags() for trigger logic only and are never written to WorldGraph]
        [e.g., plannable drive condition, then yes, can create a node with e.g., "pred:drive:hunger_high", or evidence, e.g., cue:drive:hunger_high]
        -policies use drive tags in triggering (e.g., SeekNipple needs hunger), while execute may update drives (e.g., Rest reduces fatigue a bit)
    -parameter 'ctx' represents runtime context
        -includes age_days, sigma and jump (tie-breaking, exploration settings), ticks (i.e., how many steps have passed), profile (e.g., "goat", "chimp", etc),
           winners_k, hal and body (for multi-brain scaffolding and embodiment stub)
        -policies don't really require ctx but useful for gating behavior by age/profile, calling into HAL stubs, writing provenance, e.g., ticks, to meta
    -trigger(world, drives)
    -execute(world, drives, ctx) -- appends small chain of bindings/edges and set provenance to world; adjust internal states to drives; optional gating, embodiment via ctx
    -e.g.,  def trigger (self, world, drives): if _has(world, ...) or drives.fatigue... return False
            def execute (self, world, ctx, drives): meta=... ; world.add_predicate("action:look_around"); return self._success(reward, notes, binding)
            -if display WorldGraph:  b1(NOW) --then--> b2[action:look_around]--then--> b3[state:alert]
    -when executed, a policy appends a *small chain* of predicates/edges to the WorldGraph and returns a status dict
       -status dict: {"policy": "policy:<name>", "status": "ok|fail|noop|error", "reward": float, "notes": str}.
    - Provenance: bindings created by a policy stamp meta.policy = "policy:<name>".
        "provenance" means when a primitive/policy fires and creates bindings or links we stamp metadata
        eg, "created_by: policy:<name>", timestamp, tag "policy:stand_up", "note: 'standing'"
        thus effective means recording origin so later debugging/credit assignment skill ledger,RL is explainable
        -state predicates, e.g., state:posture_standing, assert something about the agent or world that reasoner can use as facts
        -provenance tags, e.g., policy:stand_up, assert who/what produced this binding/edge rather than something  plan for, it already occurred
        -despite the same effect predicate being produced there could have been two different policies creating it, provenance tags help figure out which one
        - Skill ledger: tiny RL-style counters (n, succ, q, last_reward) per policy; not used for selection yet.

Clarification of Predicates versus other similar looking terms
--------------------------------------------------------------
-only predicates or cues or anchors are written to the WorldGraph, i.e., they live in the bindings (nodes)
-drive:* tags which we now call "flags" to reduce confusion are ephemeral and are not written to the WorldGraph or the binding's records
-it is possible to make a drive:* flag into a predicate or cue to put on the WorldGraph if it was to be used for planning /inspection purposes,
    e.g., "pred:drive:*" or "cue:drive:*"
-"state:posture_standing" is shorthand for the token part of the full predicate which is "pred:state:posture_standing", i.e, "pred:state:*"
-   we use state:* tokens for relatively stable facts about the agent/world and are ok to persist in the WorldGraph
-"action:run" would normally be stored on the edges as execution provenance; however can turn into a predicate "pred:action:run" for
   WorldGraph is want the action as a fact for planning or for inspection
-worldgraph==world stores pred:<token>, where <token> may be state:*, action:*, etc.
-the controller uses ephemeral drive:* flags (never written as pred:*) to decide triggers.
-for compatibility, we sometimes write a legacy alias and the canonical tag on the same binding
   (e.g., pred:posture:standing and pred:state:posture_standing) so older tests/tools still work while new code reads the canonical form.


Token quick-ref (canonicalization & usage)
------------------------------------------

Families in the WorldGraph:
  • pred:*     — facts (assertions the reasoner can use)
  • cue:*      — observations/engram evidence (non-factual sensory tags)
  • anchor:*   — structural anchors (NOW, LATEST, etc.)

Canonical tokens (second-level namespaces under pred:*):
  • state:*    — relatively stable facts about agent/world (e.g., state:posture_standing)
  • action:*   — action semantics / provenance (e.g., action:look_around)
    NOTE: prefer keeping actions on edges; assert pred:action:* only when a fact is needed.

Controller-only flags (never written as pred:*):
  • drive:*    — ephemeral homeostatic flags derived from Drives (e.g., drive:hunger_high)

Why constants:
  • Single source of truth, IDE autocomplete, fewer typos.
  • Easy refactors (rename once; keep legacy in CANON_SYNONYMS for back-compat).
  • Clear lexicon surface for docs/tests.

Reading & writing helpers:
  • _canon(token)                 → maps legacy → canonical (e.g., "posture:standing" → "state:posture_standing")
  • _add_pred(world, token, ...)  → adds pred:<canonical_token> (WorldGraph prefixes 'pred:')
  • _has(world, token)            → True if pred:<canonical OR legacy> exists (alias-aware)

Back-compat policy (WorldGraph only):
  • For selected tokens we tag the SAME binding with both the legacy alias and canonical tag
    (e.g., pred:posture:standing + pred:state:posture_standing) so older tools/tests still pass.

Naming rules:
  • snake_case, colon-namespaces, no spaces.
  • state:* uses noun phrases (state:posture_standing).
  • action:* uses verb phrases (action:orient_to_mom).
  • Avoid inventing new top-level families; prefer state:* or action:* and document here.

Common tokens (constants → stored token):
  • STATE_POSTURE_STANDING  → state:posture_standing    (legacy: posture:standing)
  • STATE_POSTURE_FALLEN    → state:posture_fallen      (legacy: posture:fallen)
  • STATE_RESTING           → state:resting
  • STATE_ALERT             → state:alert
  • STATE_SEEKING_MOM       → state:seeking_mom         (legacy: seeking_mom)
  • ACTION_PUSH_UP          → action:push_up
  • ACTION_EXTEND_LEGS      → action:extend_legs
  • ACTION_LOOK_AROUND      → action:look_around
  • ACTION_ORIENT_TO_MOM    → action:orient_to_mom

Usage patterns (examples):
  • Write a fact:
      b = _add_pred(world, STATE_POSTURE_STANDING, attach="latest", meta=meta)
      # In real WorldGraph, the same binding also carries the legacy alias for compatibility.

  • Check a fact (alias-aware):
      if _has(world, STATE_POSTURE_STANDING): ...

  • Add a new canonical token:
      NEW_CONST = "state:foo_bar"
      CANON_SYNONYMS.update({"legacy:foo": NEW_CONST})  # optional back-compat mapping

Agent loop note:
  • Drives produce drive:* flags (ephemeral).
  • Action selection can prefer policies linked to the largest drive deficits; the controller
    remains the safety gate (e.g., stand up if fallen), while the world stores only pred:* facts.


Action loop
-----------
-the Action Center is like a single-step orchestrator --
   -safety short-circuit, e.g., if the world shows a fallen state then immediately run StandUp
   -otherwise scan PRIMITIVES in order call trigger(world, dirves)
   -run the first policy whose trigger is True --> _run wraps execute(...) and updates the skill ledger
   -returns a status dict {"policy":"policy:<name>" | None, "status": "ok|fail|noop|error", "reward":float, "notes":str}
-the order of PRIMITIVES matters and we placed in our priority scheme:
   StandUp (safety) --> SeekNipple(hunger) --> Rest (fatigue) --> FollowMom (fallback) --> ExploreCheck (stub)
-permissive fallback (e.g., FollowMom) (i.e., a policy whose trigger(...) is basically always True or at least in most normal states)
  -the action center returns {"status":"noop"} only when no policy triggers
  -if FollowMom.trigger(...) is nearly always True, then never see a "noop" because the fallback will always fire and produce an "ok" step instead
  -if ever want occasional no-ops (i.e., do nothing ticks) then tighten FollowMom(...) trigger (e.g., return False if tired/hungry/just acted) or
     move FollowMom even further down or add a timer/debounce so it doesn't constantly fire
-when multiple policies trigger, selection defaults to deficit scoring with legacy-order fallback
-selection defaults to deficit scoring; to integrate an external adviser, pass preferred='policy:...' (controller remains the safety gate)

       actually provide the concrete behavior
    -note: I have decided to avoid the full richness of Python (e.g., import ABC and use the abstractmethod decorator)
            here and similar analogous coding/concpets in other places of the codebase, to keep the programming level
            and concepts reasonable (i.e., pragmatic) for future maintainers (hs -- oct '25)
    -shared interface/contract: trigger(...) and execute(...) effectively enforce that the subclass must have its own specific trigger() and execute()
            and if not, trigger() running in the base will return False or execute running in the base ill return self._fail()

    policy that assumes the safety posture is already under control.

    Triggers (read-only gates)
    --------------------------
    • hunger_high flag present (from Drives.flags())
    • upright (either canonical 'state:posture_standing' or legacy 'posture:standing')
    • not fallen (canonical or legacy)
    • not already in a 'seeking_mom' state (canonical or legacy)

    Execution (world writes)
    ------------------------
    1) Append `pred:action:orient_to_mom` (attach='now').
    2) Finalize with a "seeking" state:
       • Real WorldGraph: write legacy `pred:seeking_mom` and also tag the SAME
         binding with `pred:state:seeking_mom` for canonical reads.

#   1) Safety short-circuit: if the world shows 'fallen' → run StandUp immediately.
#   2) Otherwise scan PRIMITIVES in order and call trigger(world, drives) on each (cheap, read-only).
#   3) If multiple triggers are True, select by deficit score (e.g., hunger for seek, fatigue for rest),
#      with this list order as a final tiebreaker. See _policy_deficit_score(...) and the Action Center notes.
#   4) Execute the chosen policy; _run(...) ensures skill accounting on success/failure.
#
# Policy summaries (why this order):
#   • StandUp      — Safety-first posture recovery; must come first.
#   • SeekNipple   — Hunger-driven seeking; runs when upright & hungry, not fallen, not already seeking.
#   • Rest         — Homeostatic recovery when very fatigued; placed before the permissive fallback.
#   • FollowMom    — Permissive fallback (trigger is usually True); keeps the loop producing 'ok' steps
#                    instead of 'noop' when nothing else is pressing. Tighten its trigger if you want
#                    occasional no-op ticks.
#   • ExploreCheck — Diagnostic placeholder; disabled stub for future exploration logic.
#
# **Important**
#      -When you add a new policy class, you must also instantiate it and add it to PRIMITIVES or
#        the Action Center will never consider it.
#      -The list’s order matters (used as a final tie-breaker after deficit scoring), so place your new policy where its priority makes sense.

        1) Safety override: if fallen, force StandUp (ignores 'preferred').
        2) If 'preferred' is provided, execute that exact policy (controller still handles errors).
        3) Otherwise: evaluate triggers; if multiple triggered, choose by drive deficit
           If all scores are zero, fall back to the legacy scan order for backward-compat.

    -sample input parameter arguments, e.g. --
      world  = <cca8_world_graph.WorldGraph object at 0x0000021DC0A50C50>
      ctx =  Ctx(sigma=0.015, jump=0.2, age_days=0.0, ticks=0, profile='Mountain Goat', winners_k=2, hal=None, body='(none)')
      drives = Drives(hunger=0.7, fatigue=0.2, warmth=0.6)

    -preferred trigger mechanism --
        - Provide an external agent with a small state (see drives_summary(...), and any
          whitelisted world facts). Let that agent suggest 'preferred' by name.
        - Pass preferred='policy:...' here. Safety checks still run first.
        - This preserves a single source of truth for execution while allowing richer selection
          logic without coupling the controller to any specific agent/LLM.
