OS: win32 (see system-dependent utilities for more detailed system/simulation info)
(for non-interactive execution, ">python cca8_run.py --help" to see optional flags you can set)

Embodiment:  HAL (hardware abstraction layer) setting: OFF (runs without consideration of the robotic embodiment)

    Select: Selection: Run n Cognitive Cycles (closed-loop timeline)

This selection runs several consecutive closed-loop cognitive cycles between the
HybridEnvironment (newborn-goat world) and the CCA8 brain.

For each cognitive cycle we will:
  1) Advance controller_steps and the temporal soft clock once,
  2) STEP the newborn-goat environment using the last policy action (if any),
  3) Inject the resulting EnvObservation into the WorldGraph as pred:/cue: facts,
  4) Run ONE controller step (Action Center) and remember the last fired policy.

This is like pressing menu 35 multiple times, but with a more compact, per-cycle summary.
You can still use menu 35 for detailed, single-step inspection.

[policy-selection] Candidates = dev_gate passes AND trigger(...) returns True.
[policy-selection] Winner = highest deficit → non_drive → (RL: q | non-RL: stable order).
[policy-selection] RL adds exploration: epsilon picks a random candidate; otherwise we exploit the winner logic above.

How many closed-loop cognitive cycle(s) would you like to run? [default: 5]: 
Legend (console tags):
  [env-loop]      closed-loop driver (one cognitive cycle = env update → policy select → policy act)
  [env]           environment events (reset/step; with HAL ON, this would be real sensor I/O)
  [env→working]   EnvObservation → WorkingMap (fast scratch / map surface)
  [env→world]     EnvObservation → WorldGraph (long-term episode index)
  [env→controller] Action Center output (policy selection + execution)
  [wm<->col]      WorkingMap ⇄ Column keyframe pipeline (store snapshot → retrieve candidates → apply/merge priors)
  [pred_err]      prediction error v0 (expected vs observed); gates auto-retrieve and shapes policy value via penalty on streaks
  [gate:<p>]      gating explanation for policy <p>
  [pick]          which policy was selected this cycle
  [executed]      policy execution result (effects show up in the NEXT cycle's observation)
  [maps]          selection_on=map used to score; execute_on=map used to run actions
  [obs-mask]      partial-observability masking (token drops) when enabled

[env-loop] Running 50 closed-loop cognitive cycle(s) (env↔controller).
[env-loop] Each cognitive cycle will:
  1) Advance controller_steps and the temporal soft clock (one drift),
  2) Call env.reset() (first time) or env.step(last policy action),
  3) Inject EnvObservation into the WorldGraph as pred:/cue: facts,
  4) Run ONE controller step (Action Center) and store the last policy name.

[env-loop] Note: this episode has not started yet; the first cognitive cycle will call env.reset().
[env-loop]       (With HAL ON, this is where we'd sample the first real sensor snapshot.)

[env-loop] explain posture: posture remains 'resting'; no storyboard transition affecting posture this step.
[env-loop] explain nipple: nipple remains latched; the kid continues feeding at the maternal nipple this step.
[env-loop] explain zone: zone is 'safe'; BodyMap sees shelter near and no nearby cliff, so this is a sheltered niche suitable for resting and feeding.

[skills-hud] Learned policy values after env-loop:
(terminology: hud==heads-up-display; n==number times policy executed; rate==% times we counted policy as successful;
  last==reward value that policy received the last time it executed; q==learned value estimate;
  EMA==exponential moving average of rewards; q_new = (1-alpha_smoothing_factor)*q_old + alpha*reward (alpha ~0.3))
(if RL=enabled, epsilon is theoretical % times to choose randomly, 'explore_rate' is measured % of random choices;
   delta=0 then q used only for exact ties otherwise deficit values within delta range are considered tied and q used to decide)
NOTE: deficit here means drive-urgency = max(0, drive_value - HIGH_THRESHOLD) (amount ABOVE threshold, not a negative deficit).
Policies without a drive-urgency term score 0.00 and will tie-break by stable policy order (or RL tie-break, if enabled)
RL: enabled=True epsilon=0.050 delta=0.000 (explore=0, exploit=6, explore_rate=0.00)
Skill HUD (top 3 by q=EMA reward):
   1) policy:stand_up     n=  4  rate=0.75  q=+0.52  last=+1.00
   2) policy:recover_fall  n=  1  rate=1.00  q=+0.24  last=+0.80
