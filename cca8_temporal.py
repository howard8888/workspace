CCA8 Temporal Module
cca8_temporal.py


-Time helpers for stamping bindings (e.g., `meta["created_at"]`) and optional period/year tagging. The WorldGraph itself is atemporal
except for anchors like `NOW`. Temporal semantics are layered via meta and planning constraints (i.e., we do not bake clock logic
into the graph -- we should keep it in this module or the runner module).
-WorldGraph stays an episode index with anchors like "NOW" while time semantics are layered via 'meta' and planning constraints.
-ISO-8601 strings -- format is YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss where 'T' is a separator between date and time, i.e., timespec = 'seconds', with
optional period/year and planning constraints.
-Naive local time, no timezone
-Provenance stamps everywhere any actions write -- each time a binding is created there is a stamp 'created_at' (ISO-8601, seconds precision)
by the policy creating it and meta["policy"]= "policy:<name>" .
-Note that at present, this Temporal Module does not participate in timestamping, i.e., meta["policy"]= "policy:<name>" . The policies are
  timestamped directly in the Controller Module (e.g., FollowMom, Rest, etc)

-Thus, much of this module is to support the TemporalContext vector. Why a temporal vector if we already have timestamps?
-Our timestamps, i.e., essentially ISO-8601 wall-clock time, is great for provenance and logs, but it is less useful for:
1. Segmentation -- e.g., "When did one episode end and the next begin?"
-we could invent ad-hoc boundaries, e.g., if there is a 5 second gap then that is a boundary, etc, but these rules will fail, e.g., sim speed varies
2. Similarity Search -- "Fetch things that happened around the same time as X."  With just a timestamp you're doing range filters and unit conversions--
nothing really says "nearby" in a smooth way.
-the vector is not as much work computationally as it sounds -- we use a unit-norm vector that either drifts with time (small steps) but jumps
(at event boundaries), giving us essentially a cheap, geometry-based notion of "near in time" with no parsing, no units -- just dot products.
-cos(v_now, v_then) ~ 1.0 implies close in time.
-cos() falling below a threshold -- likely a boundary.
-We pick a threshold τ (e.g., 0.9) for boundary detection by comparing the current vector to the last boundary vector.

-After each drift step or jump boundary we L2 re-normalize the vector, i.e., back to length 1, since we are assuming cosine = dot product
- cosine(θ) = cos(θ) = "cos" shorthand -- for non-zero vectors it gives a measure of similarity of vectors across any number of dimensions
- cos(θ) = (u <dot> v)/ (||u||*||v||)), thus θ = arccos( (u <dot> v)/ (||u||*||v||)))
- since unit-norm ||u|| = ||v|| = 1, therefore cos(θ) = u <dot> v  and thus (θ) = arccos(u <dot> v)
  thus, for unit-norm vectors, cosine equals the dot product.
- same direction with θ= 0 then cos = 1
- orthogonal with θ = 90 then cos = 0
- opposite direction with θ = 180 then cos = -1
- e.g., u = [1,2,2], v= [2,1,2], thus dot = 8;  ||u|| = sqrt(9) = 3, ||v|| = sqrt(9) = 3; cos = 8/(3*3) = 0.889; θ = arccos(.889) = 27 deg
- e.g., u = [1,0,0], v = [0,1,0], thus dot = 0, thus cos = 0, thus θ = 90 deg (orthogonal)
- this math is relatively simple, thus I have decided not use Numpy for now -- the Python code is fast enough
- the renormalization (see code) is also simple, i.e., L2 norm and divide, so again Python code is fast enough for now

-The vector itself is a 128-dim (adjustable dims) list of floats, always re-normalized to a unit length vector
-there is a demo block of code
e.g., TemporalContext vector at 8-D is:   TemporalContext(dim=8, sigma=0.02, jump=0.25, _v=[-0.08324498290455759, -0.09989120918728571, -0.064310263015913,
 0.4055554829134334, -0.07371129300238069, -0.8650626294215049, 0.19198953150999917, -0.15444828179956657])
 ||v0||≈1: 1.0
cos(v0, v1) after step():    0.9993346922371369
cos(v0, v2) after boundary(): 0.9303704646916311
-See the vector algebra utilities and demos below for a review of the math, particularly cosine similarity.
-note that for unit vectors 'def cos(a, b): return sum(x*y for x, y in zip(a, b))' should give similar results as our helper dot(a, b) .

-What do the contents of the TemporalContext vector really mean?
-Note from the code that effectively, as shown below, when we initialize in __post_init__  we are sampling each
 coordinate from a standard normal and then normalizing -- that is why components don't have human meaning.
-Then each tick we can add small Gaussian noise to every coordinate and re-normalize to make a tiny change in direction == a drift step.
  For larger boundary jumps we add a bigger noise which produces a larger change in direction which we exploit for episode segmentation.
-A unit vector in R^n-dim acts as a time fingerprint for "NOW".
-We update it with tiny drift steps and bigger boundary jumps.
-We don't read it component-by-component but instead we compare whole vectors to tell us near-in-time versus far-in-time.
-Consider a simple 4-D TemporalContext vector: e.g.,  v = [-0.19545054, -0.26136825, -0.14239240,  0.93445713]
-  if we square the components [[0.03820, 0.06831, 0.02028, 0.87321] and sum them [~= 1.0] then the square root is ~= 1.0
- given that 4th axis squared is .873 it indicates that about 87.3% of the direction is along the 4th axis with smaller contributions on the other axes
- it does not actually mean that the 4th time unit is dominant, just that the direction is mostly aligned with axis #4
-The axes themselves are arbitrary.
-Each float is just a coordinate projection of the current time-state onto one basis axis.
-The sign indicates which side of the axis while the magnitude indicates how much of the direction along that axis
-Meaning from the context vector only emerges by comparison. If there is a high dot product, then that means it is nearby in time. If there is a low
  dot product, then likely there was an event boundary.
-Effectively, by comparing vectors we have a cheap segmentation and retrieval mechanism, without having to invent manually-tuned clock rules

-Note that our context vector is not a learned embedding, but is a procedural “soft clock” we control.
-A learned embedding is a vector produced by a trained model -- its geometry emerges from training.
-However, our vector is produced by a fixed algorithm, no training, i.e., a procedural soft clock effectively.
-As noted above, when we initialize a context vector in __post_init__ , each tick we add tiny Gaussian noise==drift and renormalize.
-We can adjust how fast time moves via sigma==drift and how hard a chapter break feels via jump==boundary strength.
-It will be reproducible in theory if we set the same seed.
-It is content-agnostic -- it doesn't encode what happened, only when/near what it happened in the run's flow
-It is 'cheap' in that it uses O(d) math, pure Python, no training, no GPU.
-It provides us with segmentation -- use a dot-product threshold against the last boundary vector to cut episodes.
-It provides us with temporal similarity -- can fetch things from around the same time.
-In the future we can combine it with learned content embeddings as second orthogonal axis.
-However, keep in mind that won't 'learn' dataset-specific time patterns but instead it encodes relative time

-Given the above background, we can concisely consider how we utilize the temporal vectors.
-Again, they allow allow segmentation of new episodes and they allow similarity searches.
-They have relative values and not meant to be globally comparable across different runs.
-It's not a learned embedding but rather a procedural 'soft clock' we control.
-They are not a replacement for real timestamps -- as noted above we still stamp ISO-8601 for audit/provenance.
-After each drift/jump we L2-normalize the vector to length 1.
-step() adds tiny Gaussian noise -- very small direction change
-boundary() adds bigger noise -- noticeable change
-The result is to get a smooth trajectory with occasional boundary breaks
